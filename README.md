# Technical proof: database

Platform that allows users to register, track and manage package shipments domestically and internationally. The system must be able to manage multiple package types, process real-time tracking information, assign optimal routes for delivery, and provide users with detailed and up-to-date information on the status and location of their shipments. It is also required to integrate strong security and authentication features to ensure the protection of sensitive user data and the confidentiality of shipment information. The backend should be highly scalable and adaptable to accommodate future growth and changing business needs, as well as offer well-documented application programming interfaces (APIs) to facilitate integration with other external systems and services.
